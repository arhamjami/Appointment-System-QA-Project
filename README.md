# Software Quality Analysis & Functional Testing of a Web-Based Appointment System

## Overview

This project documents the manual quality analysis and functional testing of a sample **web-based Appointment Booking System**.  
The goal of the testing effort is to validate that users can securely log in, book appointments, and view confirmations with correct data, while ensuring the system behaves reliably under common and edge-case scenarios.

## Objectives

- Verify core functional flows such as login, appointment creation, and logout.
- Ensure field validations, error handling, and negative scenarios behave as expected.
- Check basic UI consistency and usability across key pages.
- Provide structured test artefacts that demonstrate a professional QA workflow.

## Included Artefacts

- **TestPlan.pdf** – High-level test strategy, scope, approach, and responsibilities.
- **TestScenarios.xlsx** – List of high-level test scenarios grouped by feature/module.
- **TestCases.xlsx** – Detailed test cases with steps, expected results, and priorities.
- **BugReport.xlsx** – Sample logged defects with severity and priority.
- **TraceabilityMatrix.xlsx** – Mapping of requirements to associated test cases.
- **TestSummaryReport.pdf** – Summary of test execution and defect status.

## System Under Test (SUT)

A conceptual **Appointment Booking System** with the following key modules:

- User Authentication (Login/Logout)
- Appointment Management (Create/Update/Cancel Appointment)
- Calendar & Date Selection
- Appointment Confirmation & Details View
- Basic UI & Navigation

> Note: This project is designed as a **Quality Analyst portfolio artefact** and can be used to demonstrate skills in test planning, execution, documentation, and reporting.
